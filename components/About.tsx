          Over the course of the 48-hour workshop, approximately 40 students
          will design a logo and brand system, a website, promotional and social
          motion graphics, as well as printed book. To accomplish all of this,
          we divide students into teams, each with different design tasks to
          work on, and we pair them with a design coach or two to help art direct
          and guide the team to completion.
